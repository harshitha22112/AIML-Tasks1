# Rearrange the columns
cars = pd.DataFrame(cars, columns=["HP","VOL","SP","WT","MPG"])

# ### Description of columns
# - MPG: Milege of the car(Mile per Gallon) Y-column to be predicted
# - HP: Horse power of the car(X1 column)
# - VOL: Volume of the car(size)(X2 column)
# - SP: Top speed of the car (Miles per Hour)(X3 column)
# - WT: Weight of the car (pounds)(X4 column)

# ### Assumptions in Multilinear Regression
# 1. Linearity: The relationship between the predictors(X) and the response(Y) is linear.
# 2. Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
# 3. Homoscedasticity: The residuals(Y-Y_hat) exhibit constant variance at all levels of the predictor.
# 4. Normal Distribution of Errors: The residuals of the model are normally distributes.
# 5. No Multicollinearity: The independent variables should npt be too highly correlated with each other.
# 
# Violatios of these assumptions may lead to inefficiency in the regression parameters and unreliable predictions.

# ### EDA

# In[7]:


cars.info()


# In[8]:


# Check for missing values
cars.isna().sum()


# ### Observations
# - There are no missing values
# - There are 81 observations (diff cars data)
# - The data types of the columns are also relevant and valid

# ### Observations from boxplot and histograms
# - There are some extreme values observed towards the right tail of SP and HP dustributions.
# - In VOL and WT columns, a few outliers are observed in both tails of thier distributions.
# - The extreme values of cars data may have come from the specially designed nature of cars.
# - In multi dimensional data, the outliers that are spatial dimensions may have to be considered while builiding the regression model.

# ### Checking for dulpicated rows

# In[15]:


cars[cars.duplicated()]


# ### Pair plots and correaltion coefficients

# In[17]:


# Pair plot
sns.set_style(style='darkgrid')
sns.pairplot(cars)


# In[18]:


cars.corr()


# ### Observations from pair plot 
# - The highest correlation is observed between WT and VOL (0.999203)
# - The correlation is observed between SP and HP (0.973848)

# ### Observations
# - Between x and y, all the x variables are showing moderate to high correlation strengths, highest being between HP and MPG.
# - Therefore, the dataset qualifies for building a multiple linear regression model to predict MPG.
# - aMONG X COLUMNS(X1,X2,X3 AND X4), some high correlation strengths are observed between SP vs HP, VOL vs WT.
# - The high correlation among x columns is not desirable as ti might lead to multicollinearity problem.

# In[38]:


#build model
#import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
model1 = smf.ols('MPG~WT+VOL+SP+HP', data=cars).fit()


# In[40]:


model1.summary()


# ### Observations from model summary
# The R-squared and adjusted R-squared values are good and about 75% of variablity in Y is explained by X xolumns
# The probability value with respect to F-statistic is close to zero, indicating that all or someof x columns are significant
# The p-values for VOL and WT are higher than 5% indicating some interaction issue among themselves, which need to be furtherÂ explored

# ### Performance metrics and model1
# 

# In[48]:


# Find the performance metrics
# Create a data frame with actual y and predicted y columns
df1 = pd.DataFrame()
df1["actual_y1"] = cars["MPG"]
df1.head()


# In[50]:


# Predict for the given x data columns
pred_y1 = model1.predict(cars.iloc[:,0:4])
df1["pred_y1"] = pred_y1
df1.head()
